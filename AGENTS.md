# Agent Operating Gate

1. Read `.ai/OPERATING_RULES.md` before starting any task.
2. Treat `.ai/STATE.md` and `.ai/TASKS.md` as the canonical continuity memory.
3. After any meaningful code/config/behavior/CI/build change, update both `.ai/STATE.md` and `.ai/TASKS.md` in the same change set.
4. Do not rely on chat history as durable memory; repository files are the source of truth.
