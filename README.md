AI workflow note: AI agents must follow `AGENTS.md` and update `.ai/STATE.md` + `.ai/TASKS.md` after meaningful changes.
Handoff note: start with `.ai/HANDOFF.md` for current status and execution order.
Workspace governance: `.ai/WORKSPACE_GOVERNANCE.md` defines canonical vs staging paths and mirror sync rules.

Primary runtime and release docs are in `v3/README_V3.md`.
